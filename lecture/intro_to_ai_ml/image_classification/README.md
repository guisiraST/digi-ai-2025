## Image classification 

### Task Requirement (15 points):
* Using the provided test set dataset to build an image classification system to classify a multiclass dataset, Develop and evaluate 3 different approach
    * (3 points) Build and train a CNN without using any pre-trained weights. (you are not allowed to use test set for training.) 
    * (3 points) Use  pre-trained model (e.g., VGG, ResNet) without trainingÂ 
    * (3 points) Use a pre-trained model as a base and train the model using your training dataset  (you are not allowed to use test set for training.) 
    * You can use other additional approach to solve this problem
* (2 points) You are required to conduct at least three distinct experiments to evaluate how different techniques impact the performance of your model. These experiments can be: Difference pretrained model,  Image preprocessing, Data augmentation, Model Parameter tuning or other technique. 
* (2 points) Each experiment must include a detailed performance. 
    * Training and validation accuracy/loss
    * Classification performance across each class
    * Visual examples of misclassified images
    * Other
* (2 points) Provide an analysis of all experiments, highlighting the impact of each technique on model performance and identify which combinations were most effective.
